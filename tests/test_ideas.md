## ideas

test should run main.py on 10 different images (ranging from easy screenshot text, handwriting, outdoors/indoors print, signage, menus, weird fonts, cluttered images, low light, upside down)

report levenstein difference of result and actual text - ex "lowlight - LD 4, 96% correct"
report overall LD and percent for all tests
